### Procedure

1. **Setup**-  Place the drawing board on a smooth, and levelled surface. Attach the drawing paper to the drawing board using clips or masking tape. Ensure if the paper’s edges are properly aligned with the T-square.  

2. **Border**- Draw borders around the drawing sheet by using HB pencil, leaving some space for dimensioning and notes. Generally, the border is drawn wider on the left side of the drawing.   

3. **Title block**- A title block is created at the right-hand bottom corner of the drawing sheet. It must contain the following details, name of the firm, drawing title, date, scale, method of Projection used. 

4. **Drawing instruments**- Gather all the necessary drawing tools such as pencils of different grades, drafter, erasers, dividers, protractors, scales, etc.  

5. **Projection**- Draw the main views of the drawing, based on the method of Projection ( isometric, orthography, etc), keeping the initial lines light and clear. 

6. **Construction lines**- Draw construction lines using light pencil strokes, and accurately position different features. Use various types of lines—such as thick, thin, and dashed—to distinguish between visible, hidden, and center lines.

7. **Dimensioning and lettering**- Add clear, readable dimensions to your drawing using proper arrowheads and units. Label the drawing neatly following the guidelines to maintain uniformity. 

8. **Reviewing**-  Check your drawing for accuracy and completeness in all aspects. Use erasers for making necessary corrections. The finished drawing should be concise, clear and perfect following the guidelines.
